                I am a junior fullstack developer. Mostly working with 
                php and bitrix, and with html, css, js and jquery.
                Now I'm looking for a job as a frontend developer,
                because I am interested in React, js and interfaces.
                I try to keep up with best practices, and am always 
                looking for new things to learn.
            </p>
        </div>
